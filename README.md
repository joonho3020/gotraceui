# gotraceui - an efficient frontend for Go execution traces

Gotraceui is a tool for visualizing and analyzing Go execution traces. It is meant to be a faster, more accessible, and
more powerful alternative to `go tool trace`. Unlike `go tool trace`, Gotraceui doesn’t use deprecated browser APIs (or a
browser at all), and its UI is tuned specifically to the unique characteristics of Go traces.

## Installation

Users of Nix can use the flake. There are no packages for other distributions or OSs yet and you will have to build
`github.com/joonho3020/gotraceui/cmd/gotraceui` yourself. The manual contains information on how to.

## Manual

Gotraceui [includes a manual](https://github.com/dominikh/gotraceui/releases/latest/download/gotraceui.pdf) in PDF form.
Each [release](https://github.com/dominikh/gotraceui/releases) includes the manual as an asset.

## Notes for package maintainers
